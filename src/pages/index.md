  Straights & Curves is an independent, handmade zine focused on the intricacies
  of running and life. Our name, Straights & Curves, is derived from both the
  straight and curved parts of the track and the straights and curves of
  everyday training and life. Our mission is to capture the heart and soul of
  the Portland running community (and beyond) in written, print format.
