  Straights & Curves is an independent, running-centric zine published in
  Portland, Oregon. Our mission is to bring forth the matter beneath the surface
  of running and what makes it a part of culture rather than a hobby. While
  Straights and Curves is based in Portland, we aim to represent all ages,
  backgrounds and abilities from running communities across the world. The ways
  in which we all enter the sport of running can vary greatly. Our goal is to
  write and create something that puts those variances on display in a way that
  connects us all.
